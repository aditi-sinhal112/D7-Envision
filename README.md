<h1 align="center">Design and Implementation of Obstacle Avoiding Line Follower Robot </h1>

## Introduction

In this project we made a simulation of a line follower robot using CoppeliaSim software.  

 
Line follower is one kind of autonomous robot which follows a line until that line exists. The robot follows the line by using two sensors on both sides of the robot. These sensors the line and make the decision to change the speed of the motors and turn accordingly.

## Creation of the Robot and the Line

We make a BubbleRob Model on CoppeliaSim software using various primitive shapes,sensors,motors,etc. We can start off by making the robot using this [tutorial](https://manual.coppeliarobotics.com/en/bubbleRobTutorial.htm). 

We then make Line for the robot to run on. We can do it easily using this [tutorial](https://manual.coppeliarobotics.com/en/lineFollowingBubbleRobTutorial.htm).
We then decorate the robot according to us and our structure of robot and line is now complete.

## Scripting the Robot and the Line

You can find the required code for instructions in the below files in this repo.
